#Multi-Launcher For Path of Exile

I had the idea to create this "multi-launcher" in order to have only one executable to launch all the softwares revolving around POE, like POB (Path of Building) when I start a new character, or TradeMacro once I'm at the level of being interested in the economy of the game.

- Download this project as a ZIP file.
- Unzip it.
- Put the unzip folder anywhere you want on your computer.
- Put inside it the shortcuts for POE, POB, TradeMacro named as follows:
    - PathOfExile
    - PathOfBuilding
    - TradeMacro
- Create a shortcut to the launch.bat file on your desktop.
- Re-name it as you wish and launch it!

Note :  
If you are using Steam to launch Path Of Exile, please make sure that the POE shortcut is an executable, not a link (.url). This will be in your "Steam" directory like this:  
`Steam\steamapps\common\Path of Exile\PathOfExileSteam.exe`  

See you at Wraeclast, or at Oriath! Bye Exile.
